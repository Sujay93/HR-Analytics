## Business Problem
* The company has recently observed an unusually high number of employees leaving the organization, leading to growing concern among senior leadership. Despite offering industry-standard salaries and training programs, attrition has climbed above 50%, affecting critical   departments such as Research & Development and Human Resources.
* Management is perplexed by the rising turnover and lacks clarity on the underlying causes. To address this, the HR department has           initiated a comprehensive data analysis aimed at uncovering the key factors driving attrition — such as work-life balance, job              satisfaction, commute distance, and departmental dynamics — with the ultimate goal of improving employee retention and organizational stability.
