## Business Problem
* The company has recently observed an unusually high number of employees leaving the organization, leading to growing concern among        senior leadership. Despite offering industry-standard salaries and training programs, attrition has climbed above 50%, affecting          critical departments such as Research & Development and Human Resources.
* Management is perplexed by the rising turnover and lacks clarity on the underlying causes. To address this, the HR department has         initiated a comprehensive data analysis aimed at uncovering the key factors driving attrition — such as work-life balance, job            satisfaction, commute distance, and departmental dynamics — with the ultimate goal of improving employee retention and organizational     stability.

## Insights

1. **High Attrition in R&D and HR Departments**: R&D shows the highest attrition rate (51.21%), followed by the HR department,              indicating potential department-specific issues.

2. **Frequent Overtime Linked to Lower Performance:** Employees working overtime consistently show lower average performance ratings,       suggesting burnout or overwork.

3. **Attrition Increases with Commute Distance:** A clear upward trend is observed between distance from home and attrition, especially     beyond 10–15 km.

4. **Job Roles like Sales Executive Have Poor Work-Life Balance:** Certain job roles report significantly lower work-life balance          scores, especially Sales-related functions.

5. **Higher Training Hours Show Slight Performance Gains:** Employees with more training hours generally perform better, though the         impact varies by department.

6. **Salary Hikes Don’t Guarantee Satisfaction:** While salary hikes do boost satisfaction to a degree, some employees with good hikes      still report dissatisfaction.

7. **Unequal Distribution of Stock Options:** Stock options are disproportionately allocated, which may contribute to perceived             inequality across departments.

## Recommendations

1. **Address Attrition in R&D and HR:** Conduct exit interviews and departmental audits to understand pain points and improve retention     strategies.

2. **Control Overtime and Promote Work-Life Balance:** Enforce limits on overtime and provide resources to reduce workload pressure,        especially in underperforming teams.

3. **Offer Flexible or Hybrid Work Options:** Reduce commute-related attrition by offering remote work flexibility or transport             incentives.

4. **Reassess Job Role Expectations:** For roles with poor work-life balance, revise performance targets or redistribute                    responsibilities.

5. **Increase Investment in Targeted Training Programs:** Focus training on departments or roles with lower performance to improve          outcomes and motivation.

6. **Enhance Retention Beyond Compensation:** Along with salary hikes, improve recognition programs, internal mobility, and employee        engagement initiatives.

7. **Ensure Fair and Transparent Incentive Structures:**
   Align stock option and benefit distribution with performance and department needs to improve morale.
